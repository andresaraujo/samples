# Bridge :heart: Web 1.0

This is an example project with a classic todo list, without front end scripts, with forms
and postback. Like in the good ol' days.

## Try it
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/dart-bridge/samples
...
> cd samples/classic_todo
> pub get
...
> cp .env.production .env
> dart bridge start
Server started on http://localhost:1337

```

Open up [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) in any browser and you should see the app.
